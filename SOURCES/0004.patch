Subject: [PATCH] 40network: Don't include 40network by default

commit 7347391 ('network-legacy: split off from network module')
splitted network function to network-legacy and removed check() function
of 40network. This caused 40network to be included even if network is
not needed.

Signed-off-by: Kairui Song <kasong@redhat.com>
